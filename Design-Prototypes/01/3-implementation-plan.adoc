== Implementation

The implementation process will follow a modular and iterative approach, focusing on microservice-based development and integration. Below are the steps and tools required:

=== Frontend Implementation
1. **Storefront (ReactJS)**:
   - Set up the ReactJS project using `create-react-app` or `Vite` for a lightweight build.
   - Implement the following pages:
     - **Login Page**:
       - Integrate with the Identity Service via REST API for authentication.
       - Handle token storage using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
     - **Product Listing Page**:
       - Fetch and display products from the Product Service.
     - **Order Page**:
       - Display order history by integrating with the Order Service.
   - Tools and Libraries:
     - React Router (for navigation).
     - Axios or Fetch API (for API integration).
     - TailwindCSS or Material-UI (for styling).

2. **Backoffice (Angular)**:
   - Set up the Angular project using the Angular CLI.
   - Implement the following modules:
     - **User Management**:
       - CRUD operations for user roles and permissions via the User Service.
     - **Product Management**:
       - CRUD operations for products via the Product Service.
     - **Order Management**:
       - Fetch and update order statuses via the Order Service.
   - Tools and Libraries:
     - Angular Router (for navigation).
     - Angular Material or PrimeNG (for UI components).
     - RxJS (for reactive programming).

=== Backend Implementation
1. **Identity Service**:
   - Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and authorization.
   - Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Azure AD.
   - Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using ASP.NET Identity or external providers.
   - Secure APIs with JWT-based authentication.

2. **User Service**:
   - Create RESTful APIs for managing user data.
   - Define roles and permissions in a database (e.g., SQL Server).
   - Ensure the SuperAdmin user is pre-seeded during database initialization.

3. **Product Service**:
   - Define product schemas in a database.
   - Implement APIs for CRUD operations.
   - Use Entity Framework Core for database interaction.

4. **Order Service**:
   - Create APIs for managing orders and their associated order lines.
   - Implement business logic for order status transitions (e.g., Verified, Cancelled).
   - Use event-driven architecture for order updates if needed.

5. **Inventory Service**:
   - Implement logic for inventory calculations (e.g., `AvailableQty = InstockQty - OrderedQty - CommitQty`).
   - Create APIs for inventory management and real-time updates.
   - Use a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for high-performance inventory lookups.

6. **Payment Service**:
   - Integrate with third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
   - Implement APIs for payment processing and querying payment statuses.

=== API Gateway
- Use a reverse proxy such as Nginx or Traefik for routing.
- Implement centralized authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

=== Deployment
- Use Docker to containerize all frontend and backend services.
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration in production.
- Define CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Azure DevOps.

=== Monitoring and Logging
- Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
