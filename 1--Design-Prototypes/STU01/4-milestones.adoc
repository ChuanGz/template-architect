== Milestones

The project will be broken down into the following milestones, with each milestone focusing on specific deliverables to achieve a working system incrementally:

=== Milestone 1: Project Setup and Architecture (2 Weeks)
- Set up the Git repository and CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- Create the project structure for frontend and backend.
- Set up the API Gateway and basic routing to all microservices.
- Define shared contracts for API specifications using OpenAPI or Swagger.
- Configure Docker Compose for local environment setup with all services.

=== Milestone 2: Identity Service and Authentication (2 Weeks)
- Implement the Identity Service with the following features:
  - User authentication (username/password) with JWT.
  - Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with Microsoft accounts.
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Secure API Gateway routes using JWT validation.
- Create a login page on the Storefront and Backoffice to test authentication flows.

=== Milestone 3: Backend Core Services (3 Weeks)
- **User Service**:
  - Implement CRUD operations for user roles (Guest, Member, Backoffice User, SuperAdmin).
  - Seed the SuperAdmin user during initialization.
- **Product Service**:
  - Implement CRUD operations for products, including file upload for product images.
  - Store and serve product images via a file system or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
- **Order Service**:
  - Implement APIs for order creation, retrieval, and status updates.
  - Ensure validation rules for `Verified` and `Cancelled` order statuses.
- **Inventory Service**:
  - Implement APIs for inventory updates and availability checks.
  - Define calculations for `AvailableQty = InstockQty - OrderedQty - CommitQty`.

=== Milestone 4: Frontend Integration (3 Weeks)
- **Storefront (ReactJS)**:
  - Display product listing with images, price, and instock status.
  - Add the Buy functionality to create orders.
  - Integrate the order history page to display past orders for logged-in users.
- **Backoffice (Angular)**:
  - Add CRUD pages for user management and product management.
  - Implement order management with Cancel and Verify buttons.
  - Integrate file upload functionality for product images.

=== Milestone 5: Payment Integration and Testing (2 Weeks)
- **Payment Service**:
  - Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for payment processing.
  - Implement APIs to process payments and retrieve payment statuses.
- End-to-end testing of the order-to-payment workflow.

=== Milestone 6: Deployment and Monitoring (2 Weeks)
- Containerize all services using Docker.
- Deploy the system to a production environment using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
- Set up monitoring and logging:
  - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
  - Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
- Finalize and document deployment guides.

=== Milestone 7: Final Review and Handover (1 Week)
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with key stakeholders.
- Document the system, including:
  - API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
  - Architecture diagrams and setup instructions.
- Handover the project to the operations team.
