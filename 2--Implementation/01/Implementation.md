# Implementation steps
## Step 1: Project Setup
- Create the Repository:
  - Set up version control using GitHub, GitLab, or another platform.
  - Define repository structure: Separate folders for frontend (/frontend) and backend microservices (/services).
  - Add README files and initial documentation.
- Configure CI/CD Pipelines: 
  - Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
  - Set up automated builds and deployments for:
      - Frontend applications.
      - Each backend microservice.
- Dockerize Services:
  - Write Dockerfile for each service.
  - Create a docker-compose.yml file to set up the local environment with:
    - API Gateway.
    - Backend services.
    - Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQL Server).

## Step 2: Backend Implementation
Identity Service:

Implement authentication and authorization:
JWT token generation and validation.
SSO integration with Microsoft accounts.
MFA for additional security.
Expose APIs (/login, /mfa/verify).
User Service:

Implement CRUD operations for user profiles and roles.
Seed the SuperAdmin user on database initialization.
Product Service:

Define schema for products (including image support).
Set up endpoints for CRUD operations.
Add file storage logic for image uploads.
Order Service:

Build APIs for order creation, retrieval, and status updates.
Validate business rules for statuses (Verified, Cancelled).
Inventory Service:

Implement logic for inventory tracking (e.g., InstockQty, OrderedQty).
Set up endpoints for querying and updating inventory.
Payment Service:

Integrate with Stripe or PayPal for payment processing.
Expose APIs for payment transactions.

## Step 3: Frontend Implementation
Storefront (ReactJS):

Create pages for:
Login and registration.
Product listing and details.
Order history.
Integrate with backend APIs for:
Authentication.
Product retrieval.
Order management.
Backoffice (Angular):

Create modules for:
User management (CRUD for roles and users).
Product management (CRUD with image upload).
Order management (status updates for orders).
Connect to backend APIs.

## Step 4: Integration and Testing
API Integration:

Connect frontend to backend APIs.
Test all endpoints for correctness and security.
Unit and Integration Testing:

Write unit tests for each backend service.
Conduct integration tests to validate data flow across services.
End-to-End Testing:

Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to simulate user workflows.
Test storefront and backoffice functionality.

## Step 5: Deployment
Prepare Production Environment:

Use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for orchestration.
Set up load balancers and scaling policies.
Monitoring and Logging:

Configure monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
Set up centralized logging with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
Deploy the System:

Deploy the frontend applications and backend services.
Perform smoke testing to ensure all components work in production.

## Step 6: User Acceptance and Feedback
Conduct UAT:

Share the system with key users for testing.
Collect and address feedback.
Finalize Handoff:

Deliver system documentation, including deployment guides and API specs.
Train stakeholders on the system.
