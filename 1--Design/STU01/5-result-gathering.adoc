== Gathering Results

The success of the project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

=== Functional Validation
1. **Frontend (Storefront)**:
   - Verify that product information is displayed accurately, including:
     - Product image
     - Price
     - Instock status
   - Confirm users can:
     - Log in successfully and view their order history.
     - Place orders using the "Buy" button.
   - Validate that order placement and retrieval integrate correctly with the backend.

2. **Frontend (Backoffice)**:
   - Ensure CRUD operations for users and products function as expected.
   - Verify product images can be uploaded and displayed correctly.
   - Test order status updates:
     - Orders can be marked as **Cancelled** or **Verified**.
     - Verified orders are immutable.

3. **Backend Microservices**:
   - Validate each microservice's API endpoints for correctness and performance.
   - Verify the functionality of the Identity Service, including:
     - Authentication and JWT token generation.
     - Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
   - Confirm data consistency between:
     - Order Service and Inventory Service.
     - User Service and Identity Service.

=== Performance Evaluation
1. Ensure system stability under high load:
   - Test up to 1000 concurrent users placing orders.
   - Simulate backoffice user activity during peak storefront usage.
2. Measure API response times:
   - Average response time < 200ms under normal load.
   - 95th percentile response time < 500ms under high load.

=== Security and Compliance
1. Verify security measures:
   - Ensure authentication tokens are secure and properly validated.
   - Test MFA flows for security and reliability.
2. Conduct a penetration test to identify vulnerabilities.
3. Confirm compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

=== User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
1. Gather feedback from:
   - Storefront users for ease of use and functionality.
   - Backoffice users for operational efficiency.
2. Address any critical feedback before final deployment.

=== Monitoring and Logging Validation
1. Validate monitoring setup:
   - Ensure key metrics (e.g., API performance, inventory updates) are tracked in Grafana.
2. Verify logging:
   - Ensure all critical events are logged and can be reviewed in Kibana.

=== Final Handoff
1. Deliver the system documentation, including:
   - API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
   - Deployment guides and diagrams.
   - User manuals for Storefront and Backoffice.
2. Confirm all requirements have been met and approved by stakeholders.
